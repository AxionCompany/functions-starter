# AXION FUNCTIONS STARTER TEMPLATE

This is a Deno-based starter template for the AXION FUNCTIONS library. It helps
you develop software in JavaScript by mapping the file structure into endpoints.
This template already includes some examples under the 'functions' directory.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure you have Deno installed locally. If you
don't have Deno installed, you can follow the instructions below to install it:

1. Visit the Deno website: https://deno.land/
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Getting Started

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/axion-functions-starter.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd axion-functions-starter`
3. Install the dependencies: AH-HA! You do not need to explicitilly install any
   dependencies with Deno. Skip this step.
4. Start the development server: `deno task dev`
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8001/helloworld` to see an
   example endpoint of the application running.
6. Test other endpoints (e.g. `http://localhost:8001/helloworld/your-name`,
   `http://localhost:8001/jsx/HelloWorld`,
   `http://localhost:8001/jsx/HelloWorldWithState`, etc)
7. Develop your own endpoints by adding new files under the `functions`
   directory.
8. Enjoy the hassle-free development experience for setting up endpoints and SSR JSX components.

## Production

```sh
deno task start
